# Liberate Gold Components
Provides easy access to units and components of GoldMod.

<br>

**WARNING:**

This is effectively a cheat mod. This mod gives the player access to over-powered units and/or components. Don't use this mod, if you don't want the original game-play of the game spoiled for you!

<br>

**Notes:**

This mod basically gives you easy access to most of the components of GoldMod.

<br>

There is no need to research any of these components. They are all unlocked by default.

<br>

This mod gives you easy access to Golden units, Golden turrets, and Golden wall blocks. All very beautiful eye-candy.

<br>

Right now, this mod provides 5 factory buildings, so that you can build (and use) all of the Golden units. {No reconstructor blocks are necessary.}

<br>

This mod can be used in the campaign, to get an extra boost of units, which are a bit stronger than most of the vanilla in-game units.

<br>

The Golden walls are very strong, ...to assist you in the campaign.

<br>

The Golden turrets have lots of fire-power, ...to assist you in the campaign.

<br>

I made this small mod, because I wanted to play with the Golden units and components, but I did not want to spend hours and days gathering all the required resources (items), in order to unlock all the components of GoldMod on the Tech Tree.

<br>

I hope you enjoy this mod, and have fun with it.
